# PyFlappyDot

A clone of the famous game Flappy Bird. This game, is programmed in Python and Pygame library, uses the common graphics with dots and rectangles, real-game sound effects and a system font - Arial.

This game uses a self-building "Scene Manager", which is a list of "Scene", and managers it with "ID". Flappy Dot has 3 "Scene", includes TitleScene, GameScene and EndScene. TitleScene is the "Scene" that it shows a label "FLAPPY DOT" and a label helping player space and play. GameScene, like its name, is the main "Scene", having all of game's character and playing. The last scene, EndScene, shows that player has already losen and space to restart the game.

All about algorithms, thinkings have already contained in file-comments. Just reads, and tries it. Thanks !
